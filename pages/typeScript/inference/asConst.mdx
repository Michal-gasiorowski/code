# As Const

Sometimes default infered type is not strict enough, or maybe typescript will infer a type as too general.

## Defining

```ts filename="asConst.ts" copy
const numbersArray = [1, 2, 3];
// numbersArray is inferred as number[]

const numbersArrayAsConst = [1, 2, 3] as const;
// numbersArrayAsConst is inferred as readonly [1, 2, 3]

const object = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3,
};
// object is inferred as { a: number, b: number, c: number }

const objectAsConst = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3,
} as const;
// objectAsConst is inferred as { readonly a: 1, readonly b: 2, readonly c: 3 }

const stringArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
// stringArray is inferred as string[]

const stringArrayAsConst = ["a", "b", "c"] as const;
// stringArrayAsConst is inferred as readonly ["a", "b", "c"]

const nestedObject = {
  a: {
    b: {
      c: 1,
    },
  },
};
// nestedObject is inferred as { a: { b: { c: number } } }

const nestedObjectAsConst = {
  a: {
    b: {
      c: 1,
    },
  },
} as const;
// nestedObjectAsConst is inferred as { readonly a: { readonly b: { readonly c: 1 } } }
```

As you can see, `as const` changes the type of the variable to be more strict, and it also makes the variable readonly.

## Usage

Lets try to make some practical usage of `as const`. Imagine we have a function that takes some `routes` as an argument, but we dont want to allow any string to be passed as a route, we want to allow only routes that we have defined in our app.

```ts filename="asConstUsage.ts" copy
const routes = {
  home: "/",
  about: "/about",
  contact: "/contact",
} as const;

type Routes = typeof routes;
// type Routes = {
//   readonly home: "/";
//   readonly about: "/about";
//   readonly contact: "/contact";
// }

type Route = Routes[keyof Routes];
// type Route = "/" | "/about" | "/contact"

function navigateTo(route: Route) {
  // ...
}

navigateTo(routes.home);
navigateTo("/");
// this is also fine, because "/" is the same as routes.home

navigateTo("/foo");
//Argument of type '"/foo"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"/" | "/about" | "/contact"'.
```

## Getting rid of readonly

Sometimes we want to get rid of readonly, for any rason, sometimes its even some quirks required by some library. We have two options to deal with it.

### foo as foo

```ts filename="asConstUsage2.ts" copy
const routes = {
  home: "/",
  about: "/about",
  contact: "/contact",
} as {
  home: "/";
  about: "/about";
  contact: "/contact";
};
```

This is the simplest way, but it requires us to write the type twice, which is not very DRY.

### Writtable

We can create a type that will make all properties of an object writable, by using `-readonly` mapped type.

```ts filename="asConstUsage3.ts" copy
type Writeable<T> = { -readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] };

const routes = {
  home: "/",
  about: "/about",
  contact: "/contact",
} as const;

type Routes = Writeable<typeof routes>;
// type Routes = {
//   home: "/";
//   about: "/about";
//   contact: "/contact";
// }
```

If we want to recursively make all properties of an object writable, we can use this type:

```ts filename="asConstUsage4.ts" copy
type DeepWriteable<T> = { -readonly [P in keyof T]: DeepWriteable<T[P]> };
```

## Bonus

Its beyond the scope of this article, but lets try to figure out how Writeable type works.

```ts filename="writtable.ts" copy
type Writeable<T> = { -readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] };
// desired functionality
const testObj = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
} as const;
// object is readonly

type typeOfTestObj = typeof testObj;
// type typeOfTestObj = {
//    readonly a: 1;
//    readonly b: 2;
// }
```

Lets try to describe what `Writeable` does:

- it takes a generic type `T`
- it maps all keys of `T` to a new type
- it stores all keys of `T` under a generic `P`
- it returns a new type under each of the keys of `T`, using `P` to access the value of `T`
- (to this point, it basically returns the same type as `T`)
- it removes `readonly` modifier from each of the keys of `T`

Lets try to recreate `Writeable` type step by step.

```ts filename="writtable.ts" copy
type mappedToNull = { [key in "a" | "b"]: null };
// type mappedToNull = { a: null; b: null; }

type mappedToKey = { [key in "a" | "b"]: key };
// type mappedToKey = { a: "a"; b: "b"; }

type keys<T> = keyof T;
type testObjKeys = keys<typeOfTestObj>;
// type testObjKeys = "a" | "b"

type mappedObj = { [key in testObjKeys]: key };
// type mappedObj = { a: "a"; b: "b"; }

type mappedObjOneLiner = { [key in keys<typeOfTestObj>]: key };
// type mappedObjOneLiner = { a: "a"; b: "b"; }

type mappedObjWithGeneric<T> = { [key in keys<T>]: key };
type newMappedObj = mappedObjWithGeneric<typeOfTestObj>;
// type newMappedObj = { a: "a"; b: "b"; }

type usingKeysToAccessObj<T> = { [key in keys<T>]: T[key] };
type newMappedObj2 = usingKeysToAccessObj<typeOfTestObj>;
// type newMappedObj2 = {
//    readonly a: 1;
//    readonly b: 2;
// }

type removingKeysHelper<T> = { [key in keyof T]: T[key] };
type newMappedObj3 = removingKeysHelper<typeOfTestObj>;
// type newMappedObj3 = {
//    readonly a: 1;
//    readonly b: 2;
// }

type removingReadonly<T> = { -readonly [key in keyof T]: T[key] };
type newMappedObj4 = removingReadonly<typeOfTestObj>;
// type newMappedObj4 = {
//    a: 1;
//    b: 2;
// }

type replacingKeyWithP<T> = { -readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] };
type removedReadonly = replacingKeyWithP<typeOfTestObj>;
// type removedReadonly = {
//    a: 1;
//    b: 2;
// }
```

Now, lets break it down:

- `typeOfTestObj` is the type of our object, with readonly properties
- `mappedToNull` is a mapped type, that maps all keys of our object to null using `in` syntax. `key` is a generic, that can have any name we want.
- `mappedToKey` is a mapped type, that maps all keys of our object to the key itself.
- `testObjKeys` is a type that contains all keys of our object
- `mappedObj` is a mapped type, that maps all keys of our object to the key itself, by using `testObjKeys` type
- `mappedObjOneLiner` is the same as all stepes abouve, but written in one line
- `mappedObjWithGeneric` is the same as `mappedObjOneLiner`, but using generic to pass the type of our object
- `newMappedObj` is our new type, mapped with `mappedObjWithGeneric`
- `usingKeysToAccessObj` is a mapped type, that maps all keys of our object to the value that is under that key
- `newMappedObj2` is our new type, mapped with `usingKeysToAccessObj`
- `removingKeysHelper` is the same as `usingKeysToAccessObj`, but we replaced `keys<T>` with `keyof T`, same built in that we used in `keys<T>`
- `newMappedObj3` is our new type, mapped with `removingKeysHelper`
- `removingReadonly` is the same as `removingKeysHelper`, but we added `-readonly` to the key. Minus sign is a special syntax that tells typescript to remove a modifier from the key. We can also add `+` to add a modifier to the key.
- `newMappedObj4` is our new type, mapped with `removingReadonly`
- `replacingKeyWithP` is the same as `removingReadonly`, but we replaced `key` with `P`. `P` is a generic, that can have any name we want.
- `removedReadonly` is our new type, mapped with `replacingKeyWithP`

This way, step by step we created exact same type as `Writeable` type. `DeepWriteable` works the same way, but it uses recursion to call itself on nested objects.
