# As Keyword

Using the as keyword, you can 'force' typescript to treat a variable as a specific type. This is useful when you know that a variable is of a certain type, but typescript cant infer it.

## Basics

In following implementation, `typedAnimal` function returns a `Dog | Cat` type. However, we know that the return type is `Cat` because we are passing a `cat: Cat` object to the function. In this case, we can use the `as` keyword to force typescript to treat the return type as `typeof cat` which in this example is `Cat`.

```ts filename="as.ts" copy
type Dog = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const dog: Dog = {
  name: "dog",
  age: 10,
};

type Cat = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isEvil: boolean;
};

const cat: Cat = {
  name: "cat",
  age: 10,
  isEvil: true,
};

type Animal = Dog | Cat;

function typedAnimal(animal: Animal) {
  if ("isEvil" in animal) {
    return animal;
  }
  return animal;
}

const animal = typedAnimal(cat) as typeof cat;
// animal: Cat
```

However, this is not ideal to cast the return type using `as` each time, instead we can use generics to infer the return type.

```ts filename="genericsInsteadOfAs.ts" copy
type Animal = Dog | Cat;

function typedAnimal<T extends Animal>(animal: T): T {
  if ("isEvil" in animal) {
    return animal;
  }
  return animal;
}

const animal = typedAnimal(cat);
// animal: Cat
```

  In most cases you should avoid using `as` keyword, and instead use generics to
  infer the type, or use other stratiegies to narrow down the type instead of
  simply telling typescript to treat the value as a specific type.

## Not compatible types

Sometimes we want to cast some value to a type that is not compatible with the value. Consider the following example:

```ts filename="notCompatible.ts" copy
type Horse = {
  name: string;
  isFast: boolean;
};

const animal = typedAnimal(dog) as Horse;
// Conversion of type 'Dog' to type 'Horse' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other.
// If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
// Property 'isFast' is missing in type 'Dog' but required in type 'Horse'.
```

Lets look at another example: we have a fumction, that expect certain type, but we want to pass a different type to it because we know, that the function will work with it.

```ts filename="notCompatible2.ts" copy
type Dog = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const dog: Dog = {
  name: "dog",
  age: 10,
};

type Horse = {
  name: string;
  isFast: boolean;
};

function typedAnimal(animal: Horse) {
  return animal.name;
}

const animal = typedAnimal(dog as Horse);
// Conversion of type 'Dog' to type 'Horse' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other.
// If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
// Property 'isFast' is missing in type 'Dog' but required in type 'Horse'.
```

We got the same error, but we know that what we want to return from the function is just `animal.name` which is property that both `Dog` and `Horse` have. In this case, we can use `unknown` type to cast the value to it, and then to the type we want.

```ts filename="notCompatible3.ts" copy
const animal = typedAnimal(dog as unknown as Horse);
// no error
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  Using `as unknown as` is not a good practice, and should be avoided, as its
  simply disconnecting typescript from the value, and telling it to treat it as
  a different type no matter what.
