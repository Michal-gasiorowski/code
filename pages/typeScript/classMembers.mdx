# Class Members

In TS you have control over whether methods or properties are visible / can be modified from outside the class.

## Public

The default visibility of class members is `public`. Public members can be accessed from anywhere. Also, this is a default state, so you don't have to specify it.

```ts filename="person.ts"
class Person {
  public name: string;
  surname: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.surname = "Doe";
  }
}

const myPerson = new Person("John");

console.log(myPerson.name); // log: John
console.log(myPerson.surname); // log: Doe
```

## Private

Private members can only be accessed from within the class. This means that you can't access them from outside the class, nor from any class that extends it.

```ts {2, 17} filename="person.ts"
class Person {
  private name: string;
  surname: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.surname = "Doe";
  }

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

const myPerson = new Person("John");

console.log(myPerson.name);
//Property 'name' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'

console.log(myPerson.getName()); // log: John
console.log(myPerson.surname); // log: Doe
```

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  As you can see, even if the `name` property is private, we can still access it
  from within the class. This allow us to create a method that returns the value
  of the private property.
</Callout>

Its also not possible to access such properties from within a class that extends it. Lets assume, that Person is a class from previous example.

```ts {3} filename="person.ts"
const ExtendedPerson = class extends Person {
  getName() {
    return `${this.surname}, ${this.name}`;
    // Property 'name' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'
  }
};
```

## Protected

Protected members can be accessed from within the class and from within classes that extend it.

```ts {2, 17} filename="person.ts"
class Person {
  protected name: string;
  surname: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.surname = "Doe";
  }

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

const myPerson = new Person("John");

console.log(myPerson.name);
//Property 'name' is protected and only accessible within class 'Person' and its subclasses.
```

Unlike private members, protected members can be accessed from within a class that extends it.

```ts {3} filename="person.ts"
const ExtendedPerson = class extends Person {
  getName() {
    return `${this.surname}, ${this.name}`;
    // no error
  }
};
```

## Readonly

Readonly properties can only be set in the constructor. This means that you can't change them after the object is created, even from within the class.

```ts {2, 11, 18} filename="person.ts"
class Person {
  readonly name: string;
  surname: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.surname = "Doe";
  }

  overrideName(name: string) {
    this.name = "Jane";
    // Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
  }
}

const myPerson = new Person("John");

myPerson.name = "Jane";
// Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
```

## Static

Static members are not tied to a specific instance of a class. This means that you can access them without creating an instance of a class.

```ts filename="person.ts"
class Person {
  static surname = "Doe";
  name: string;
  gender: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.gender = "male";
  }
}

console.log(Person.surname); // log: Doe
console.log(Person.name); // log: undefined
console.log(Person.gender);
// Property 'gender' does not exist on type 'typeof Person'.
// its not static nor default property and Person is not instanciated object

const myPerson = new Person("John");

console.log(myPerson.name); // log: John
console.log(myPerson.gender); // log: "male"
console.log(myPerson.surname);
// Property 'surname' does not exist on type 'Person'.
// Did you mean to access the static member 'Person.surname' instead?
```

Static members can also use the same public, protected, and private visibility modifiers.

```ts filename="person.ts"
class Person {
  private static surname = "Doe";

  // rest of the class
}

console.log(Person.surname);
//Property 'surname' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.
```

## Abstract

Abstract classes can't be instanciated. They are used as a base class for other classes. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods, which are methods that don't have a body which then are implemented in classes that extend the abstract class.

```ts filename="person.ts"
abstract class Person {
  name: string;
  surname: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.surname = "Doe";
  }

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
  abstract getFullName(): string;
}

class John extends Person {
  getFullName() {
    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;
  }
}

const myPerson = new Person("John");
// Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.

const myJohn = new John("John");
console.log(myJohn.getFullName()); // log: John Doe
console.log(myJohn.getName()); // log: John
```
