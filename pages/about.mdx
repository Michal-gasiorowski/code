My name is Micha≈Ç and i am a software developer. Over the years i have been working with many different technologies, starting from QBasic and Turbo Pascal, up to stuff like DSP.

In 2020 i started to work with React and with Next.js soon after. Now i decided to share my knowledge with others. I hope you will find this site useful.
